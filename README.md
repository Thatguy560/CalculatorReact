A fairly straight forward calculator made with React, I installed 'Math.js' to evaluate expressions. Provides you with fundamental functionality to help solve rudimentary problems and basic trigonometry.

# Installation

1. Clone the repo

2. type "git clone https://github.com/Thatguy560/CalculatorReact.git" in the terminal

3. cd into 'CalculatorReact' (Change directory's)

4. npm install

# Using The App

1. Open up a terminal in your text editor and type 'npm start'

2. This should then automatically open the app on your browser, however if it doesn't just open up any browser of your choosing and type in the url "http://localhost:3000/".

3. Once the page is loaded, feel free to play around with it. All buttons are fully functional, if you make an error you can undo it with the "DEL" button, alternatively you have the option to clear the screen completely with "AC".
